// This file defines how user data is stored in the database (like a blueprint). It includes fields like name, email, and password. It also has a feature to securely hash passwords(Before saving a user's password, it is hashed (encrypted) to protect it. This way, even if someone gains access to the database, they can't easily read the passwords.) before saving them to the database, ensuring user passwords are stored safely. The User model is exported to be used in other parts of the application, like the authentication controller and middleware.

const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bcrypt = require("bcryptjs"); //a library used to securely hash (encrypt) passwords.

const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema(
  {
    firstName: {
      type: String,
      required: function () {
        return this.isNew || this.firstName; // Required only for new users
      },
    },
    lastName: {
      type: String,
      required: function () {
        return this.isNew || this.lastName; // Required only for new users
      },
    },
    email: {
      type: String,

    },
    password: {
      type: String,
      required: true,
    },
  },
  { timestamps: true }
);

// Password hashing before saving
UserSchema.pre("save", async function (next) {
  // pre(save) means: "Before saving any user document to the database, do something."
  if (!this.isModified("password")) return next();
  //If the password hasnâ€™t been changed (e.g., updating a user's email), skip hashing.
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
  this.password = await bcrypt.hash(this.password, salt);
  next();
  // salt makes the hash unpredictable and protect against password-cracking techniques
  // the value in the salt(10) means round the more rounds the more cpu time takes and more encrypted password from brute-forces attacks
  // Even if passwords share the same initial characters, the salt ensures that each password is hashed differently
